# Riddle of Sphinx

> Then anwser to the riddle of Sphinx is hidden in one of box, use your skills to check it out!

## Mission

two box holding the right and wrong anser, using `if` statement to check key word(a person)!

## How?

You got two black boxes `green_box` and `red_box`, one of them hold the right answer of sphinx's riddle. But you have no idea to tell exactly which one contains the right anwser. So, how to figure it out?

Let's decompose this task into two major steps:

- What is the right anwser of sphinx's riddle? Maybe we could just have a key word for it!
- How to check the two box with python code?

For the first task, after some research, you may find the key word of the anwser is `person`.

For the the second task, we could use `if` statement to check some varaible in Python.

For example:

```
if "person" in green_box:
    print("Haha! I found the anwser in green box!")
```
