# Riddle of Sphinx

> Then anwser to the riddle of Sphinx is hidden in one of box, use your skills to check it out!

## Mission

two box holding the right and wrong anser, using `if` statement to check key word(a person)!

## How?

You got two black boxes `green_box` and `red_box`, one of them hold the right answer of sphinx's riddle. But you have no idea to tell exactly which one contains the right anwser. So, how to figure it out?

Let's decompose this task into two major steps:

- What is the right anwser of sphinx's riddle? Maybe we could just have a key word for it!
- How to check the two box with python code?

For the first task, after some research, you may find the key word of the anwser is `person`.

For the the second task, we could use `if` statement to check some varaible in Python.

For example:

```
if "person" in green_box:
    print("Haha! I found the anwser in green box!")
```

## Video Narration

----

IN PROJECT MAP:

```
* Hello everyone, welcome to 'letspy today'! A Minimal Python Coding Playground!
* This is the 5th video of 'Letspy Coding Playground' series.
* In the last video, we knew the `string` for the first time, and learned how to get a slice of a string.
* In this video, you will be exposed to condition statements in the purpose of checking something you need.
* Lets get started our new adventure 'Riddle of Sphinx'!
```

IN PROJECT CODING MODE:

```
* In this project we have two boxes 'green_box' and 'red_box', both are string.
* Our challenge is to check the two boxes to find out which box contains the right anwser for sphinx riddle.
* We know that the right anwser is 'a person', but we need to tell sphinx which box hold the anwser 'a persion'.
* How? 
* Well, we need to use python 'if ... else' statement to check the 'green_box' and 'red_box'
* Lets do some warm ups first in the python terminal.
```

IN PYTHON TERMINAL:

```
# the if condition check syntax like this:
today_temperature = 30
if today_temperature > 25:
    print("aha, another hot day!")
else:
    print("Well, its a nice day!")
# lets press ENTER key to execute it
# the anwser is: aha, another hot day!
# this is a basic condition check example
# lets do one more exercise to check string, this will be helpfull later:
"person" in "i am a good person"
# anwser is True
```

So, how do we make these code snippet work in this project?

```
* we click the round purple button in the sidebar to copy code snipet here, 
* then paste into code editor,
* and hit the RUN button
* Bingo!
```

OK, lets get it done now!

```
we press the RIGHT arrow key toward the exit!
```

Congratulations! 

You passed the 5th coding challenge!
