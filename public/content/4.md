# Guess My Name

> A cute robot can not remember his name, help him to figure out the first letter of his name to get out of there!

## Mission

The first two letter of his name covered, using string slice method to reveal it.

## How?

When you move the robot toward key, he will be blocked by the wall! So, you need to help him to figure out his full name!

Think about it like this:

- You got a python variable `myName` which is saving the full name of the robot!
- Extract the first two letters of `myName`, that means you want to `slice` the `myName`
- Searching key word in google: `python string slice`

Then, why using `slice` to get what you want instead of `cut`, `extract` or `manipulation`?

Well, you can try them, but for python string handling methods, in a Pythoner perspective, `slice` is the most accurate term.

## Video Narration

----

IN PROJECT MAP:

```
* Hello everyone, welcome to 'letspy today'! A Minimal Python Coding Playground!
* This is the 4th video of 'Letspy Coding Playground' series.
* In the last video, we learned how to change the children in a list called 'bridge'.
* In this video, you are going to learn how to interact with a string, and how to slice it?
* Lets get started our new adventure `Guess My Name`!
```


IN PROJECT CODING MODE:

```
* In this project, we have a string called 'myName'. you may wondering what is a string?
* It is not those stuff in violin or bow, it only exists in digital world.
* String is a primitive data type in programming language, it is just some text wrapped in quotation mark.
* In this code challenge, we need to figure out the first two letters of 'myName', how?
* Lets take a exercise first playing with the basic of a string.
```


IN PYTHON TERMINAL:

```
# we first need to define a new string like this:
my_string = "Hello World!"
# if we want to get the first letter of my string:
print(my_string[0])
# if we want to get the last letter of my string:
print(my_string[-1])
# if we want to get the first two letters:
print(my_string[0:2])
```


So, how does this project works?

```
* we copy code snipet here, then paste into code editor
* then hit the RUN button
* Bingo
```

OK, lets get it done now!

```
* we move our player, pick up the key, then climb the ladder, then walk toward the door!
```

Congratulations! 

You passed the second coding challenge!
