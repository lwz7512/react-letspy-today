# Guess My Name

> A cute robot can not remember his name, help him to figure out the first letter of his name to get out of there!

## Mission

The first two letter of his name covered, using string slice method to reveal it.

## How?

When you move the robot toward key, he will be blocked by the wall! So, you need to help him to figure out his full name!

Think about it like this:

- You got a python variable `myName` which is saving the full name of the robot!
- Extract the first two letters of `myName`, that means you want to `slice` the `myName`
- Searching key word in google: `python string slice`

Then, why using `slice` to get what you want instead of `cut`, `extract` or `manipulation`?

Well, you can try them, but for python string handling methods, in a Pythoner perspective, `slice` is the most accurate term.
