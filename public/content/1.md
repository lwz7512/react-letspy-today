# Clone Army

> Want to be a commander of clone army? double your troops, to beat the enemies!

## Mission

Your are a scientist in charge of producing clone army to defense your world. Your enemy is overwhelming, you need to double your army!

## How?

Saw the aliens below? They are overwhelming... We are having only 20 soldiers to confront 40 aliens, each soldier can only fire one missile to remove one alien. So, how to clear them all?

Answer is simple:

- Click the `Edit Code` button at the top to return code editor, 
- Check the code comment inside, 
- Change the last line from comment to code (just delete the `# ` symbol at the start of the line),
- Hit the big running man button beside the game.
- Press the LEFT MOUSE on the game stage to shot them!

## Video Narration

----

IN PROJECT MAP:

```
* Hello everyone, welcome to 'letspy today'! A Minimal Python Coding Playground!
* This is the first video of 'Letspy Coding Playground' series.
* In this video, you will be familiar with how to interact with this playground, and what make it unique?
* Lets get started with the first project 'The Clone Wars', this is the most easy one!
```

IN HOMEPAGE:

```
* Now, lets open it by click 'Explore' button.
* The first screen is called 'demo mode' which includes current project description, mission, python knowledge points in both text and video format.
* Click 'Go' button, we will be entering into 'coding mode' where the real challenge is waiting for you.
```

IN PROJECT CODING MODE:

```
* Now, we are in the playground! There are 3 main parts in this playground:  
* Instruction area, including 5 steps you could click to reveal the clues of this project.
* Coding area, including Python code snippet of current project which require you to upate with.
* Gaming area, including a mini game with a big round RUN button on the right side.
```

So, how does this project works?

```
* As the mission instruction said, you need to make the variable 'troops_amount' double from 20 changed to 40.
* So that, your soldiers will double too and be capable of killing all the aliens.
* In this project we need to get familiar with python 'comment'.
* Comments in python code or any programming language is intended to make a desciption of your code.
* To make a comment in your python code, you just need to put a number sign '#' at the start of each line.
* Another common use of comment is to temporarily disable some code from being run like our code line 4.
```

OK, lets get it done now!


```
* First, lets uncomment the line 4 by remove the number sign '#', you may noticed the code line color changed.
- In this way, we made the 'troops_amount' variable doubled!
- We are having 40 soldiers in the battle field now!
* Then, we hit the RUN button beside the game, Bingo!
```

Congratulations! 

You passed the first coding challenge!
