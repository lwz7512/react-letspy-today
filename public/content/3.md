# Make your Bridge

> A bridge is missing some bricks which are represented by '1', you got to make it up and pass safely!

## Mission

Ola needs to reach the door across the broken bridge, help him repair the bridge!

## How?

In bridge stone list, 1 repesents existing conrnerstone, 0 repesents blank space. So, when all the 0 change to 1, you would pass!

The odd positions in `bridge` are 1, 3, 5, ..., currently they are all `0`. So you need to set the odd position with `1` value like this:

```
bridge[1] = 1
bridge[3] = 1
bridge[5] = 1
...
bridge[17] = 1
```

until all the `0` in the bridge turned into `1`:

```
bridge = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```
