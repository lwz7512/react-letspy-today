# Make your Bridge

> A bridge is missing some bricks which are represented by '1', you got to make it up and pass safely!

## Mission

Ola needs to reach the door across the broken bridge, help him repair the bridge!

## How?

In bridge stone list, 1 repesents existing conrnerstone, 0 repesents blank space. So, when all the 0 change to 1, you would pass!

The odd positions in `bridge` are 1, 3, 5, ..., currently they are all `0`. So you need to set the odd position with `1` value like this:

```
bridge[1] = 1
bridge[3] = 1
bridge[5] = 1
...
bridge[17] = 1
```

until all the `0` in the bridge turned into `1`:

```
bridge = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

## Video Narration

----

IN PROJECT MAP:

```
* Hello everyone, welcome to 'letspy today'! A Minimal Python Coding Playground!
* This is the third video of 'Letspy Coding Playground' series.
* In the last video, we learned how to use `function` to peform a specific `action` and how to organize those actions in a fixed order as a `list`.
* In this video, you will be playing with python `list` again, and managing to update the elements inside the list.
* Lets start our new adventure `Make your bridge`!
```

IN PROJECT CODING MODE:

```
* In this 'Make your Bridge' game, we are going to interact with python `list` first time. 
* So, what does list look like?
* It's here, look at the 5th code line in the editor!
* The 'bridge' variable that equals to a group of zero and one numbers inside a pair of square bracket.
* So, what does the list mean for this game?
* Lets take a look at a picture!
```

IN PROJECT SKETCHPAD MODE:

```
* List is a very commonly used data type in every programming language. 
* You could think of it as a 2D storage box with unlimited cells.
* You may noticed that each number '1' represents a pillar and each number '0' represents a gap between two pillars.
* So, we need to change all the zeroes into '1'
* Lets go back to coding mode to see if we could figure out the way of changing the zero values.
```

IN PROJECT CODING MODE:

```
* See the seventh code line? bridge[1] = 1
* Lets press the RUN button!
* Aha! the bridge has the first sone!
* Then what next?
* Lets copy all the codes and paste into code.
* Hit the RUN again!
* Bingo!
* Lets walk towards the exit!
```

Congratulations! 

You passed the 3rd coding challenge!
