  ðŸ“Œ Cheat sheet for programming language is just the common and small part of those coding skills.
  ðŸ“Œ Itâ€™s helpful and could accelerate your coding process, but not the priority of your leaning process. 
  ðŸ“Œ The best practice of leaning programming is through small projects and examples. 
  ðŸ“Œ For those of cheat sheet fans, I would like to present a big picture of available python cheat sheets. 
  ðŸ“Œ You may have a clearer mind on which one suits you best.
