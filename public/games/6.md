## Free Your Troops

This project is designed to encourage user utilizing python `loop` statement to checkout a collection of data and call each of element function. 

In `MakeYourPath` project, we managed to chanege value of specific element in a list. The `for....in` statement being used in this project is very common in the daily programming task.

Imagine you have large amount of dataset which is sequential, you need to figure out which part of the dataset is what you want and which part of the dataset is illegal and not your concern. In this scenario, we would find `for...in` loop is a good fit to employ.

### Game structure

The code structrue like this:

```
├─ FlyThemUp
│  ├─ TroopsOnMyControl
│  └─ SuperSoldier
```

- FlyThemUp is the main class of this game including phaser callback functions.
- SuperSoldier is our main target, he has ability to fly only if he is set to free.
- TroopsOnMyControl is in charge of all the SuperSoldiers, you could think of it a commander.

### Main functions explanation

#### [🍭](#/disclosure?line=40) create()

The create function in this project is really straight forward, it including:

- create map and tileset
- ground layer
- batteries, player, animation, soldiers
- collider between player and ground, to keep player stand on the ground

#### [🍭](#/disclosure?line=157) update()

The only job in this update function is to update `TroopsOnMyControl` when it's ready

### Tricky Parts

> Q: Why we need to phaser atlas in this game?

```
A: Normaly we got sprite sheet which has equal size of each sprite to use, this is very convenient. But sometimes we'd meet some sprites have different size in one picture, so we use some prefessional tools like 'TexturePacker' to put all the sprites in one image file and export a json file to tell which sprite lies in where. That's the reason why we use atlas.
```

> Q: How do achieve the effect that all soldiers flying one by one?

```
A: the SuperSoldier have a parameter named as 'lazyLaunch', it's the waiting time for itself. Once a solder is created, it would assign a 10 times waiting time by its order:

new SuperSoldier(soldier, index * 10)

Actually this 'lazyLaunch' value(index*10) is a frame count number which means in which frame the soldier starts to fly.

You could think of our game is a movie, movie is playing frame by frame, each frame would be very slightly different from previous. In this way, you could see something is changing. So, in some aspect, game is like movie. only difference frame in game is rendered by software.
