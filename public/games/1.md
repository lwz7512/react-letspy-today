## The Clone Armies

- The goal of this game to demonstrate how to `double variable` in Python. 

- By presenting an interesting and compelling game scene, challengers are encouraged to create more soldiers.

- To kill all the dummy aliens by unlock & run the last code line in the project code editer.

### Game structure

The code structrue like this:

```
├─ CloneArmy
│  ├─ Soldier --> fire() --> Bullet
│  ├─ Enemy
│  └─ Bullet
```

- Main logic resides in CloneArmy class.
- Soldiers are only responsible for fire bullet.
- Bullet are only responsible for flying on creation.
- Enemy's only job is check its self dropdown if dead.

### Main functions explanation

#### [🍭](#/disclosure?line=32) create()

This main function in `CloneArmy` class is doing the following tasks:

- Create game assets like: sounds, animations, avatars.
- Create blank group like: soldiers, enemies, playerLasers.
- Create sprites like: Soldier, Enemy.
- Create mouse input interaction function.
- Create `collider` function for enemies and playerLasers collision check.
- Create welcome text

#### [🍭](#/disclosure?line=158) update()

This main function in `CloneArmy` class is mainly in charge of following tasks:

- Detect `enemies` quantities to decide if its length is zero, the game is over.
- Doing game success tasks if game is completed. 
- Task one: calling `onGameSuccess` function to nofity outside world.
- Task two: Switch to next game scene `congratulations`.

### Tricky Parts

> Q: How to have soldiers fire bullets when user click game stage?

```
A: On 'pointerdown' input event, get the first unfired soldiers column, invoke each soldier's 'fire' function, to create a bullet. Once a bullet is created, it will be flying toward enemies.
```

> Q: How to kill an enemy by a bullet?

```
A: This could be fulfilled by 'collider', a collision check function which takes two type of collide objects and a collision handler fuction as parameters. In this collision handler function, we destroy both side of collision objects and playing explosion sound, animation.
```

> Q: How to make soldiers kneel down after shooting?

```
A: Using 'this.scene.time.addEvent' function in fire() of the 'Soldier' class to delay kneeling down after 200 miliseconds, so that this delay makes its behavior more natural. To show the kneeling down gesture, Soldier should switch to its 2th frame(Soldier sprite have 2 frame, frame 1 is for standing, frame 2 is for kneeling down.)
```

> Q: How to double(or clone) soldiers onto the game stage?

```
A: In 'bingo' function, we have a 'for' loop operation to create 4rows * 5column = 20soldiers, put them onto the appropriate position, and add each of soldier object into 'soldiers' group in favor of 'fired' state checking. In the next mouse click, we'll skip these 'fired' soldiers and have next unfired 4 soldiers to fire.
```

### Knowledge & Skills in use

- game object group usage.
- physics collider function usage.
- time event handler usage.
- responsibilities planning for each role.
