## Riddle of Sphinx

This project is designed to guide you leveraging Python condition statement to discover the right answer.

In previous project, we managed to change(set) a variety of data type value such as `string`, `list`. But this time we need to check out(get) data value by `if ... else` statement. Cause often we meet some input that we have no idea of what's that exactly.

Say, we might need to do something conditinally based on the value `input data`. If that data meet our criteria we are good to go on next step, but if failed to the testing, we'd do nothing. This kind of `conditional check` is very common in programming world.

### Game structure

The code structrue like this:

```
├─ SphinxRiddle
│  ├─ constructor()
│  ├─ preload()
│  ├─ create()
│  ├─ update()
│  └─ bingo()
```

- In `contructor` function we only defined couple of global variables as game flag .
- `preload` function is responsible for loading game assets such as `tiles` and tileed json `map`.
- `create` function is responsible for creating various game layers such as `floor`, `boxes`, `door`, player and collider for them, and dialog, etc.
- `update` function is responsible for player movement control, collision test, and game success dispatch.
- `bingo` function is responsible for popping up success message, unlocking door, openning `completed` flag.


### Main functions explanation

#### [🍭](#/disclosure?line=32) create()

In create function we are creating following objects:

- tilemap, tileset, floorLayer, boxesLayer, doorLayer.
- get `pickups` which includes `doors`, through `filterTiles` function
- create animation
- create player
- create keyboard cursors
- create dialog after 1000 miliseconds of game assets creation

#### [🍭](#/disclosure?line=180) update()

In update function we are mainly doing 3 jobs:

- check collision between player and pickups
- control player movement by keyboard
- game success popup and event dispatch


### Tricky Parts

> Q: How to open the door after user sucessfully answered the question by the code?

```
A: It's simple! we just need to check the parameter `done` in `bingo` function, if the `done` is true we'll display bing text in dialog, and make `doorLayer` visible by: 

this.doorLayer.setVisible(true)
```

> Q: Why we need couple of flags such as 'complete', 'succeed'?

```
A: In order to finish this project we have two tasks to do: 

Step 1. complete the code challenge to find out the correct box
Step 2. walk towards the door and hit it.

Once we completed step 1, we'd make `this.complete` to `true`. This will unlock the door and start to check the collision to door. So, code `complete` state is a pre-requisite condition. We use it to mark the first step completion or not. In `_hitTile` function you could see the `complet` flag being checked beforehand:

  _hitTile(player, tile) {
    if (!this.complete) return
    if (!this._closeEnough(player, tile, 10)) return

    this.succeed = true // end of  game!
  }

In the second step we need to check if player hit the door by the function `_hitTile`, and save the hit state by `this.succeed`. We use this flag to dispatch success event and changed to congratulation screen in `update` function.

To simply put, we need two flags to indicate(or mark) the two tasks completion.
```


### Knowledge & Skills in use

- tilemap creation by tiled json.
- pickups figuring out by `layer.filterTiles` function.
- collider creation.
- realtime collision check by `physics.world.overlapTiles`
- keyboard interaction handler.
- layer visibility handling.
- checkout door tile id through `sphinxRiddle.json`
