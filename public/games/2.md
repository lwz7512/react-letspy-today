## Lava Adventure

- The goal in this mission is learning how to organize different actions to get through the lava valley.
- Recognize that each action is represented as a python 'function' and doing one job only.
- function could have parameters and function could be uses many times.

### Game structure

The code structrue like this:

```
├─ LavaAdventure
│  ├─ ActionManager
│  └─ Action
```

- Main logic resides in LavaAdventure class.
- ActionManager is responsible for executiing actions.
- Action is responsible for player movement like walk, jump, pivot, etc.

### Main functions explanation

#### [🍭](#/disclosure?line=45) create()

This main function in `LavaAdventure` class is doing the following tasks:

- Create graphic assets like: background, docker, pivoted.
- Create player assets: player sprite, and his animation.
- Create 3 colliders to detect collision between player with background, docker, pivoted
- Create keyboard input handler `cursors`.

In this game, we want the player to stand on the platform, avoid falling into the lava valley. In order to achieve this, we need to treat both player and platform as phsical rigid body by this setting statement:

```
this.physics.add.collider(this.background, this.player)
```

So, what does `this.background` look like?

This is the platform that the player stand on, it is actually a tilemap layer created by map.createLayer() function. We'll talk this later.

#### [🍭](#/disclosure?line=202) update()

This main function in `LavaAdventure` class is mainly in charge of following tasks:

- Detect player falling down and failure(in case of under a specific vertical position).
- Realtime collision check.
- Keyboard control toward player.
- Action manager update in realtime.

### Tricky Parts

> Q: How to have player stand on the platform rather on the ground?

```
A: To make player stand on the platform, we need 3 steps to setup!

1️⃣ In 'preload()' function:

First we need to load a game map definition file:
this.load.tilemapTiledJSON('map', 'assets/tilemaps/maps/lavaAdventure.json')

And the tile image:
this.load.image('tiles', 'assets/tilemaps/tiles/kenney_redux_64x64.png');

2️⃣ In 'create()' function:

we need to create 3 stuff: Tilemap, Tileset, TilemapLayer:

var map = this.make.tilemap({ key: 'map' }); // this is Tilemap
var tiles = map.addTilesetImage('adventure', 'tiles'); // this is Tileset
this.background = map.createLayer('background', tiles, -40, 0); // this is TilemapLayer

The reference relations among 3 thing like this:

Tilemap(map) => Tileset(tiles) => TilemapLayer(this.background)

3️⃣ Last, we use physics collider function to make player sensible with background:

this.physics.add.collider(this.background, this.player);

That's it.
```

the key reference relations graph like this:

> Q: How do we make player to do different actions?

```
In this game our mission is to arrange a sequential actions that make player doing assigned tasks one by one. So, to implement this requirement, our game design introduced two concept:  Action, ActionManager.

Action is in charge of player state updates such as position, appearance(animation).
ActionManger is in charge of action execution one by one, and remove it after one ended.

Action is easy to understand, but why we name a 'ActionManger'? 
Well, we need a role like 'manager' or 'commander' to do some dispatch work. It knows all the actions(aka tasks/commands), and when it starts its actions looping work, he will be doing such an approach:

🤔 Take first one --> 😅 Execute it --> 😉 Remove it 

Then start next iteration(action), until the actions list is empty, his work would be done.
```


### Knowledge & Skills in use

- game object group usage.
- physics collider function usage.
- time event handler usage.
- responsibilities planning for each role.
