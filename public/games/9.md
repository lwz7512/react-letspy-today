## Fix the clock

The purpose of this project is to have users exposed to the Python time API, specifically to `datetime` API.

Python have many useful [built-in modules](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html) such as `random`, `math`, `json`, `html` etc.

After we had some basic knowledge of python programming, we could have a try to other more complex and domain oriented tools.

Assume you got a swiss knife like toolset named as `datetime` module, it has lot of sub-tools, you need to figure out which tool is a good fit to fix our game challenge.

### Game structure

The code structrue like this:

```
├─ FixTheClock
│   ├─ RealClock
│   └─ DialogManager
```

- FixTheClock is the main class of this game including phaser callback functions.
- RealClock is responsible for clock display and drawing using real time in use's time.
- DialogManager is responsible for multiple dialogs display one by one after some delay.

In this game, clock and dialogs is two major part of our game, so we defined two classes to seperate our concern from main logic.

Again, this kind of design is called `Seperation of concern`. It's very common and conventinal to a good software practise.


### Main functions explanation

#### [🍭 create()](/disclosure?line=32)

In create function we add many stuff on the stage including:

- sky image as game background
- game map & tileset
- ground, decoration, mini clock, door layer
- animation, player, lord
- colliders
- cursors for keyboard interaction
- dialogs & dialog manager 
- real clock
- welcome text


#### [🍭 update()](/disclosure?line=224)

In update function we're checking following stuff to respond by each user interaction:

- player control
- dialog manager update
- clock update
- dialog manager start by player
- game success when condition meet

### Tricky Parts

> Q: How do we create some dialgo between characters in the game?

```
A: By the design of dialog manager, we seperate each of dialog in each action command. In each action we assign an different handler which is a drawing task, drawing dialog text and frame one by one after a delay time(in miliseconds):

    this.dialogs = new DialogManager([
      {action: helpme, delay: 30},
      {action: response, delay: 200},
      {action: close, delay: 300},
    ], completeHandler)

Inside of DialogManager, it only cares about executing action list, once it start running it start checking current time and compare with action delay time, if match the dialog would be drew on the stage once. Then with the time pass by, next dialog would be presented until the last action close exectued.

This is a simple dialog manager implementation, seperate specific different dialogs content with dialogs looping with time constraints.
```


### Knowledge & Skills in use

- phaser tile map creation
- tilemap creation by tiled json
- drawing simple shape by graphics
- drawing text by `add.text()`
- redraw shape by clear graphics


### Conclusion

Thank you for spending so much time taking these mini coding adventures. This is the first season of `LetsPY` playground, I hope you have enjoyed something interesting and unexpected, if you could gain some ideas or knowledge about programming I would be very gratified.

Stay tuned...
