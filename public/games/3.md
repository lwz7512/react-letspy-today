## Make your Bridge

This project is designed to help you learn the usage of Python list, specifically on how to update the elements value in a list.
By assigning the right value to the right position of the bridge list, you could fill the gap of the bridge and get through it!

### Game structure

The code structrue like this:

```
├─ MakeYourPath
│  ├─ constructor()
│  ├─ preload()
│  ├─ create()
│  ├─ update()
│  └─ bingo()
```

- In `contructor` function we defined 3 tile array: `blankRows`, `level0`, `level1` and couple of necessary flag variables .
- `preload` function is responsible for loading game assets such as `tileskenney`.
- `create` function is responsible for creating game layer, player and collider for them, etc.
- `update` function is responsible for player movement handling by keyboard, and collision test.
- `bingo` function is responsible for bridge recreation with bricks data from Python code.

### Main functions explanation

#### [🍭](#/disclosure?line=5) constructor()

You may wonder what those numbers like `107` exactly are in the `blankRows`, let me show you an image for that:

Saw the white number labeled on each of tile(cell) in the image? `107` actually represent a blank(transparent) tile(aka area) in the image. We define these tile data group beforhand in order to create some specific graphic elements in `create` function by read those number represented tile.

Start from index zero and in an order of left to right, row by row, these equal size sprites composed image is so called `tilesheet` image. Once you have an image like this, you could compose unlimited game map to use through tile map editor(aka Tiled). After you have designed an tile map, you could export it as a `json` file which could be loaded in phaser `preload` function.

#### [🍭](#/disclosure?line=116) create()

In the `create` function we will create necessary visual parts and interactions based on game assets preload above.

- Create tilemap and tiles
- Create ground(platform) layer
- Create pickups from tiles filter
- Create player and animation
- Create collider(make player stand on platform)
- Cteate keyboard interaction cursors

The difference in tilemap creation between this game and previous two is, here we use tile array as data source of tilemap, but the previous two games we used TiledJSON as data source for tilemap.

#### [🍭](#/disclosure?line=132) update()

In this `update` function we are mainly doing two tasks:

- Handling keyboard operation to move player left or right
- Detect collision between `player` and `pickups` to decide when to exit.

`pickups` array actually only saved one tile, a door(tile 151) through `map.filterTiles` function in the creation of ground layer.

### Tricky Parts

> Q: How to know player hit the door?

```
A: We could utilize the function `this.physics.world.overlapTiles` to check the collision between player and the door. 

By providing a callback function `_hitExit` we would be notified when player hit the door tile. 

It is noteworthy that `_hitExit` would be called uncertain times when player overlapped with door. So, an internal flag inside the `_hitExit` like `succeed` is required to avoid executing exit logic for many times.
```

> Q: How to recreate bridge by bricks data?

```
By transform bridge data into brick tiles, we re-create a new ground layer through `_createGroundLayer` function, each time new ground layer created, it will override the original one.
```

> Q: How to make player stand and walk on the top stone?

```
A: simple description may like this:

1. Create map by `this.make.tilemap`
2. Create tiles by `map.addTilesetImage`
3. Create groundLayer by `map.createLayer`
4. Set groundLayer collideable by `groundLayer.setCollision`
5. Lastly, create collider `this.physics.add.collider(groundLayer, this.player)`
```

### Knowledge & Skills in use

- tilemap creation by tiles array.
- pickups figuring out by `map.filterTiles` function.
- collider creation.
- realtime collision check by `physics.world.overlapTiles`
- keyboard interaction handler.
