## Pass live bridge

In previous projects, we had managed to exercise some basic operations to data collection `list`, such as `loop`, `update`. At this project, we're going to learn how to `order` a list by a specific rule.

Order operation to a dataset is a very common task for list display. It is used everywhere in your daily life, browsing a commodities list by price ascendingly or descendingly in a online store, checking out your books borrowing list by time descendingly...

When something need to be presented before your eyes, it is expected to have a specific order by a common property. Otherwise, a bunch of unrelated stuff without sharing some common features is meaningless to users.

So, let's take a look at a simple ordering application in this mini game. The challenge lies to find out appropriate API in python list.

### Game structure

The code structrue like this:

```
├─ PassLiveBridge
│  └─ MovingPlatform
│     ├─ update()
│     ├─ start()
│     └─ stop()
```

- PassLiveBridge is the main class of this game including phaser callback functions.
- MovingPlatform is responsible all the floating stones moving or stop whenever python code inputted successfully.

In this game, the moving platform is the tricky part, it's like a smart platform having its own behaviour(life) at the main logic's commands.


### Main functions explanation

#### [🍭 create()](/disclosure?line=36)

There are many stuff created in the create function:

- tilemap, tileset like other games.
- animation and player sprite.
- locker, exit, key layer.
- all the stone layers saved in `this.layerGroup` in the convenience of management.
- `pickups` including key, door tile.
- 3 colliders between player with stones, door, exit.
- moving platform.
- cursor for keyboard operation.

Although many stuff are needed for this game, but most of them have been familiar to us I believe. I'd make an extra explanation to `MovingPlatform` bewlow. So, dont worry!


#### [🍭 update()](/disclosure?line=214)

In this update check, we're doing following tasks:

- platform udpate
- player control by keyboard and position check
- collision check for player and pickups
- game failure check
- game success check

Noticed the success check lies in the last of these task list? Yeah, that's because it is the final job we would do at the end of our game!

By the way, why do we put the `platform update` at the top of main update()? 

You could imagine a background task we need first. It's trival and could run first. For a puzzle game design, backgournd environment settings or traps like this could be achieved or be working first.


### Tricky Parts

> Q: How do we put(create) stones in the game?

```
A: In this project, we have 8 pieces of stone in 2 groups. The amount and the position of all the stones is fixed in map, so, we could define them in game map with different layers. By creating stone layers with 'map.createLayer' from 'tiles', we could draw those stones onto our game stage.  The source of game map in Tiled editor actually like this:
```

![bridge_layers](games/code/pass_live_bridge_md.png)

Let's further explain the stone layer creation statement in `line 56`:

```
map.createLayer('layer_'+i, tiles, -40, -20);
```

- first parameter: 'layer_'+i is corresponding to the layer id defined in our game map above.
- second parameter: tiles is the tileset of current game, you coudld think of that graphic source.
- the third and fourth parameter is the x and y position in the game stage.

By `createLayer` API, we built the same layers as the game map designer in our game code. This is how we put stones in the game.


> Q: How do we make stones moving randomly?

```
A: Now that we have 8 stones spread in 8 layers, we add all these layers to 'this.layerGroup' in order to manage them easily. To have those stones moving, we need to utilize an animation technique in phaserjs 'Tween' for each of stone layer:

  var tween = {
    targets: layer,
    y,
    duration: 2000,
    delay: Math.random() * 500,
    ease: 'Sine.easeInOut',
    yoyo: true,
    loop: -1
  }

In this tween definiton, we defined random 'y' and random delay time to each stone layer(through tagets). So, after MovingPlatform is being started after it arrives to startMoveTime, it will start to tween all the stones untill stop function is called.
```



### Knowledge & Skills in use

- phaser tile map creation
- tilemap creation by tiled json.
- tile id retrive in `passLiveBridge.json`.
- tile(key) removal after player touch.
- layer group usage.
- Tween object attach/stop to layer
