# Pass live bridge

> You are running into a weird bridge with disorderd pillars, you need to reorder them with correct order to get through!

## Mission

The bridge is alive because its pillars constantly changing, until you reorder it acscendingly then descendingly you would be safe to pass.

## How?

Feel scared to pass the bridge? Dont worry, let's look carefully what we have and what to do!

From code comments we learned that if we want to get through the bridge we need to do 3 tasks:

- have 'yellow_stones' sorted in ascending order
- have 'red_stones' sorted in descending order
- combine two group stones into one list 'bridge_stones' below

So, we need to figure out two problems:

- how to sort a list with `ascending` and `descending` order?
- how to connect two lists into one list?

Let's do some search using key words:

`python list sort`

We could find the solution `sort()` function from a Python list.

Again we do another search using key words:

`python list connect` or `python list join` or `python list concat`

You will find the anwser is so simple! It's just a `+` operator! You could connect two list like number addition way!

So, we could figure out the final solution for this project:

```
yellow_stones.sort()
red_stones.sort(reverse=True)
bridge_stones = yellow_stones + red_stones
```

With these 3 lines code ran, the bridge will stop moving! We can go head safely!

Remember to jump and pick up the key above the bridge!
