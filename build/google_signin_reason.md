Last updated: June 27, 2022

`LetsPY`(Google Cloud project id: letspy) is a educational website whose slogan is `Minimal Python Coding Playground`. Through projects based hands-on learning approach, letspy is aiming to help coding beginner especially teenagers getting familiar with the basic coding concepts in the simple coding challenges. Learning new knowledge or skills is a hard process, so letspy tried the best to make every game project attractive and easy to get started, providng rich text/video content to assit users proceeding without much frustration and being stuck.

From a big picture, `LetsPY`'s operation cirle may like this:

```
Take Game challenge >> Win Stars >> Get Awards >> New Challenge >> ...
```

To make those steps moving continuously, Google sign in is a prerequisite condition.

Though user login is not required to practice all the game projects, but if he/she wants some bonus or know more details under the games, signin with his/her Google account is required, this would encourage those real and serious users have the privileges to access the valuable materials over the anonymous users.
