# Pass live bridge

> You are running into a weird bridge with disorderd pillars, you need to reorder them with correct order to get through!

## Mission

The bridge is alive because its pillars constantly changing, until you reorder it acscendingly then descendingly you would be safe to pass.

## How?

Feel scared to pass the bridge? Dont worry, let's look carefully what we have and what to do!

From code comments we learned that if we want to get through the bridge we need to do 3 tasks:

- have 'yellow_stones' sorted in ascending order
- have 'red_stones' sorted in descending order
- combine two group stones into one list 'bridge_stones' below

So, we need to figure out two problems:

- how to sort a list with `ascending` and `descending` order?
- how to connect two lists into one list?

Let's do some search using key words:

`python list sort`

We could find the solution `sort()` function from a Python list.

Again we do another search using key words:

`python list connect` or `python list join` or `python list concat`

You will find the anwser is so simple! It's just a `+` operator! You could connect two list like number addition way!

So, we could figure out the final solution for this project:

```
yellow_stones.sort()
red_stones.sort(reverse=True)
bridge_stones = yellow_stones + red_stones
```

With these 3 lines code ran, the bridge will stop moving! We can go head safely!

Remember to jump and pick up the key above the bridge!

## Video Transcript

IN PROJECT MAP:

```
* Hello everyone, welcome to 'letspy today'! A Minimal Python Coding Playground!
* This is the 8th video of 'Letspy Coding Playground' series.
* In the last video, we learned how to use `for` loop and `if...else` statement to complete a compound task.
* In this video, you will be exposed to the `sort` concept, you will be learning how to sort a list with descendng and accending order.
* Lets get started with our new challenge 'Pass live bridge', this is my favourite project by far!
```

IN PROJECT CODING MODE:

```
* Lets see what we could get from code comments in editor.
* You may find that we have two list to play with:
* - yellow_stones and,
* - red_stones
* we need sort 'yellow_stones' in ascending order, and sort 'red_stones' in descending order.
* Then, how?
* Well, if we have no idea how to sort a python list, the simplest solution is to Google!
* we could use these key words: python list sort
* Lets take a look at the first search result.
```

IN PROGRAMIZ PAGE & Python Terminal:


```
* The most straightforward way is reading examples:
* Let copy this code line by line
* I do not recommend you to click the right side copy button
* Because that way would make you confused about the result.
* copy first line: prime_numbers = [11, 3, 7, 5, 2]
* switch to the python terminal(or called REPL)
* then paste into our python interpreter, and Enter
* nothing happened, thats right, this line just define a list
* we skip this comment line, and copy the third line: prime_numbers.sort()
* and paste again and Enter.
* still nothing happend, but actually this line sorted the list
* lastly, we copy the fourth line, to check the the `prime_numbers` list,
* to see, if it has changed, paste, and Enter again:
* Great! the list changed to an ascending order!
* We continue to explore this document to see if any descending approach available.
* Here we could see a `reverse=...` parameter, and continue to see `sort() Parameters`
* `Sort in Descending order`
* we would find that if we set the `reverse` parameter to `True`
* the sorted list is reversed, lets go back to python terminal to have a try!
* lets roll back to this sort line, add `reverse` parameter, equals to `True`
* roll back to the print line , and Enter
* Oh, great! the list changed, 11 is the first one!
```

OK, lets get it done now!

```
* We click the round purple button in the sidebar to copy code snipet here.
* Switch back to editor, and scroll down the code editor to find the last code line,
* Click in the end of last line, press Enter key to start a new line.
* Press ctrl+v or command+v to paste the final code.
* Then hit the RUN button.
```

Bingo!

We can walk through the bridge safely, press UP arrow key first, then RIGHT arrow key,
repeat these two operations, to go the stairs up. Dont forget to jump and pick up the key!

Congratulations! 

You passed the 8th coding challenge!
