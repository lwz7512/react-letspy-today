# Which way to go

> Theare 6 possible paths in a maze, check the right path to go!

## Mission

Check each path if it includes diamond(with color) or bridge...to get the right path.

## How?

Let's first check the prerequisites in the code comments. The 3rd line mentioned:

```
all_paths = [path_object, path_object, path_object, ...]
```

In the 8h-10th lines, we know every `path_object` has a function: `includeItem(type)` to return `True` or `False`, the `type` parameter in the `includeItem` function could be one of `leaf`, `bridge`, `diamond`, `key`, `heart`, `cone`.

Then, take a close look at the map in the game, one path may include multiple `pickup`s. So, according to the description above, we could infer a Python class like this:

```
class PathObject:

    def __init__(self, *types):
        self.items = types

    def includeItem(self, type):
        return type in self.items
```

In `__init__` function, we could accept multple parameters to construct a path object like this:

```
path_object = PathObject('leaf', 'diamond', 'bridge')
```

Now, we made a big progress on figuring out the structure  of `path_object`, then, how to find a way out and what's the characteristic of the right path? if you would like to spend a few seconds on the map, you may have noticed that the right way includes a `key`!

After all these research and analysis, we have had all the necessary information to write a program and crack the maze!

So, there are three steps to complete this coding challenge:

- loop the `all_paths` list
- check path object by calling `includeItem` function, with parameter `key`
- if the result is `True`, save the path_object to `right_path`


That's it!

IN PROJECT MAP:

```
* Hello everyone, welcome to 'letspy today'! A Minimal Python Coding Playground!
* This is the 7th video of 'Letspy Coding Playground' series.
* In the last video, we had a bit sense of 'class' concept in the programming world, and learned how to loop a list.
* In this video, you will be trying to mix `for...in` with `condition check`, to make them work together.
* Lets get started with our new challenge 'Which way to go'.
```

IN PROJECT CODING MODE:

```
* Let's analyze the comments in the code editor first:
* Accordiing to the mission brief section, we would have this game's target,
* A list named as 'all_paths', including multiple 'path_object'.
* Then, according to the tips section, we know that each 'path_object' has a function 'includeItem'
* Which could be used to check the items in that path. 
* That's great! we got all the 3 important clues behind this game challenge:
- all_paths list
- path_object
- includeItem function
```

So, how do use these clues to find the right way in the maze?

```
* Now we have gotten some basic tools to do hacking work!
* Well, what's the key or necessary condition of the whole maze?
* In another word, accrording the maze settings which way is leading to the exit?
* And what kind of items is existing in that way?
* You may find that key is a blue 'key'!
* Correct! 
* We need to check each 'path_object' if it contains an item 'key'!
* This is the most pivotal step we need to implement in our code!
* Awesome, we are going to check 'path_object', but how could we have access the 'path_object'?
* The object lies in 'all_paths' list, do we have a tool to get it out?
* Sure, we have 'for...in' loop which have used in the previous project!
```

OK, lets get it done now!

```
* We click the round purple button in the sidebar to copy code snipet here.
* Switch back to editor, and scroll down the code editor to find the last code line,
* Click in the end of last line, press Enter key to start a new line.
* Press ctrl+v or command+v to paste the final code.
* Then hit the RUN button.
```

Bingo!

The robot got your instruction to find a way out!

(wait for a few seconds for robot walking toward exit!)

Congratulations! 

You passed the 7th coding challenge!
