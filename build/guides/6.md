# Free Your Troops

> Your troops are being trapped in toxic valley, you need to dispatch flying armor for each of them to get out of there!

## Mission

You are a smart commander & scientist, you need to use `for` loop to equip `flying` ability with each soldier

## How?

Every soldier in your 'troops' need 'flying' ability to escapge valley, loop the 'troops' list, get each soldier and call its 'addPower' function.

Let's take a look what we have before we delve into the solution:

- A squad of soldiers: troops = [soldier, soldier, soldier, ...soldier]
- Each soldier is represented by Python class below

Assume you have a vitual `Soldier` definition like this:

```
class Soldier:
    def addPower(self, ability):
        self.ability = ability
```

The commends tips told us that each soldier has an `addPower` function, we need to call that function, and add `flying` ability to them.

So, two question left:

- how to loop each soldier in the `troops`
- how to execute or call the soldier's `addPower` function and give the `flying` ability to it


This is the anwser:

```
# Note: code line which may prefix with four period '....' 
# is actually four space in your code
for soldier in troops:
....soldier.addPower('flying')
```

> Note: the Python syntax require two or four space prefix with code line inside a `for` loop!

## Video Transcript

----

IN PROJECT MAP:

```
* Hello everyone, welcome to 'letspy today'! A Minimal Python Coding Playground!
* This is the 6th video of 'Letspy Coding Playground' series.
* In the last video, we learned how to use `if...else` to do something under specific condition.
* In this video, you will be exposed to a new concept `class` about how to define an object, and new statement `for...in` to loop an object list.
* From this project, our learning curve is starting climb, but don't worry, you will graduately feel comfortable later.
* Lets get started our new challenge 'Free Your Troops'!
```

IN PROJECT CODING MODE:

```
* Take a look at the code editor, you may noticed the line 2 mentioned a 'Soldier' prefixed with a word `class`.
* What does this mean? 
* Let me explain this through a picture:
```

IN PROJECT SKETCHPAD MODE:

```
* We are living a world full of entity you can see it touch it and feel its exsistence.
* If we want to put all these real thing into our computer or mobile phone apps we need programmers help.
* What does he actually do to make this happen?
* All what he does is so called 'abstract' which means transforming each entitiy into a machine readable 'template' in some programmming language like Python.
* Here you could see word 'class' used in Python rather than 'template', that's because of a convention from every early thoughts.
* So, we have a basic idea about 'classified Soldier', lets go back to code editor.
```

IN PROJECT CODING MODE:

```
* The line 6 said we have a squad of uncertain number soldiers and saved(or trapped) in variable: 'troops'.
* Noticed the square brackets in the line 7? That means 'troops' is actually a Python list.
* Our job is to loop the list, more clearly speaking, we need to checkout or have access to each soldier in 'troops' list.
* Then give the solider new power 'flying' by calling solider's interface 'addPower'(described in line 3 above).
* How to do this on earth?
```

Lets get it done in this simple way if you want:

```
* We click the round purple button in the sidebar to copy code snipet here.
* Switch back to editor, and scroll down the code editor to fine the last code line,
* Click in the end of last line, press Enter key to start a new line.
* Press ctrl+v or command+v to paste the final code.
* Then hit the RUN button.
```

Congratulations! 

You passed the 6th coding challenge!
