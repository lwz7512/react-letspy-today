# Lava Adventure

> The goal in this mission is learning how to organize different actions to get through the lava valley.

## Mission

Ola is being trapped in the lava valley! Your mission is to help him out of there!

## How?

Compose a group of actions to instruct Ola walking through it. ONE line ONE action only, available actions including:

- walk(1)
- jump(1)
- pivot()

Analyze the path and terrain, what's the next step? Using which step is appropriate for Ola to move forward and won't fall down into the ground.

IN PROJECT MAP:

```
* Hello everyone, welcome to 'letspy today'! A Minimal Python Coding Playground!
* This is the second video of 'Letspy Coding Playground' series.
* In the last video, we learned how to use a Python variable and how to double it by changing a comment line to a code line.
* In this video, you will be exposed with a programming concept `function` through an `action` adventure game.
* Lets take a look!
```

IN PROJECT DEMO MODE:

```
* In this 'Lava adventure' game, we are going to compose a group of special actions with the right order to pass this challenge.
* So, what made these actions special?
* Lets take a look at our first adventure!
```

IN PROJECT CODING MODE:

```
* As the code editor describing, we have 3 type of action to use: 
* walk parentheses, jump parentheses, pivot parentheses
* why does these actions look weird?
* Acatually these actions called `function`
* So, how to understand `function` in this game?
* Lets take a look at one picture:
```

IN PROJECT SKETCHPAD MODE:

```
* Action is a behavior that people can understand and the player actually perform.
* Function is a serial of commands or calucation in digital world that represent the 'Action' in real world.
* As a programmer, your job is to compose a list of functions to fulfill some jobs like this adventure.
* So, how to make it right? lets go back to project coding mode:
```

IN PROJECT CODING MODE:

...waiting for 5 secs

```
* First we need to copy these actions in tips zone into code editor.
* And press RUN button to have a try!
* Wow! it's working!
* Then, press RIGHT ARROW to walk and press UP ARROW to jump to EXIT
```

Congratulations! 

You passed the second coding challenge!
