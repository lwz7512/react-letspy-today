# Fix the clock

> To pass the first season of this Python Coding Adventure, you need to fix the clock to enter the unlock the door of church.

## Mission

Use python time function to return the current time, you will make it works! not so hard right?

## How?

To make the clock work again, we need to figure out the correct `current` time using our Python knowledge!

As the code comments said, we're going to use Python `datetime` module, and `now()` function from `datetime` object.

Let me explain a bit more about this statement:

```
now = datetime.datetime.now()
```

- `now` is a `datetime` object
- the first `datetime` in the above statement is the module you imported at the top
- the second `datetime` in the above statement is a `class` in the `datetime` module

You got the `now` object, so you are almost approaching the final anwser very close.

Checkout the official 'datetime' module api doc to find what does now() return.

Lastly, I would like to remind you, write 3 anwsers of what you found in the code lines:

```
hour = None
minute = None
second = None
```

Replace `None` with you anwser from `now` object already defined above!

Then you would pass! Good luck!

## Video Transcript

----

IN PROJECT MAP:

```
* Hello everyone, welcome to 'letspy today'! A Minimal Python Coding Playground!
* This is the 9th video of 'Letspy Coding Playground' series.
* In the last video, we learned list operations like sorting and connectioning.
* In this video, you are going to welcome another new concept `module` in Python.
* We are going to introduce `datetime` module to figure out current hour, minute, and second.
* Lets get started our new challenge 'Fix the clock', this is the last project of the first season!
```

IN PROJECT CODING MODE:

```
* According to the game instruction, we need to press RIGHT arrow key toward door keeper.
* When meet the man, he said the clock has broken, need someone to give it a fix.
* So, we got our mission, then, where to start?
* Aha, the comments in the code editor gave us the solution!
* We already have a 'datetime' class included through a way: 'import'.
* What does 'import' do and what is 'datetime'?
* Well, you could think of that as our commands to computer: 
* please import datetime class from a module named 'datetime' into our program.
* To fix the clock, we need to use the 'now' object,
* to get the 'hour', 'minute', 'second' value from it!
* Lets take a look at tutorials below:
```

IN GEEK PAGE & Python Terminal:

```
* Lets copy the first line: from datetime import datetime
* Paste into our Python terminal, and copy the second line: 
* today = datetime.now(), and paste into our Python terminal
* Nothing happed, that's right, because we have nothing to output.
* Then, we copy this hour print line: print("Hour: ", today.hour)
* to get current hour, is it correct? sure! 
* We found the first solution to get current hour!
* Could we directly use the `today.hour` as our first step to fix clock?
* Well, not exactly, why?
* Take a look at the codes in editor, did you find a variable named 'today'?
* No! it's not there!
* So, we need to replace the variable 'today' with 'now'.
```

OK, lets get it done now!

```
* We need to replace the first 'None' with our solution: now.hour
* Then replace the second 'None' with our second solution: now.minute
* Lastly, replace the third 'None' with our third solution: now.second
* And hit the RUN button!
```

Bingo! You fixed the clock! it's running!

Now, you could walk toward the door!

Congratulations! 

You passed the 9th coding challenge!
